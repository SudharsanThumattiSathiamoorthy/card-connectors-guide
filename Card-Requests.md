A card request consists of one or more tokens. These tokens might be pulled from the text of an email, or they might be from the client's environment &mdash; for example, the user's email address.

The [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) for a card request can be found [here](https://vmwaresamples.github.io/card-connectors-guide/#schema/herocard-request-schema.json).

Here is an example request:

```javascript
{
  "card_requests": [
    {
      "name": "External Weather con.",
      "tokens": {
        "zip": [
          "30080",
          "30067",
          "30332",
          "00100"
        ]
      },
      "connector_id": "238ff136-1f49-4c88-8acd-aa4c3749a75c"
    }
  ]
}
```
